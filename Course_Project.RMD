The following report will detail the analysis performed for the Regression Models class for the Data Science Specialization at Coursera and the John Hopkins Institute of Public Healh. 
Several analysis were performed on the base R dataset `mtcars` to answer the following to questions:

1. “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
2. "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

```{r}
# Loading in the data.
data("mtcars")
library(knitr)

# Transforming the proper variables to factor variables. 
cols <- c("cyl", "vs", "gear", "carb")
mtcars[, cols] <- lapply(mtcars[, cols], as.factor)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))
```

```{r}
# Some exploratory analysis.

kable(summary(mtcars))
```
